Emergency Medical Dispatch is the practice of utilizing trained and certified personnel to receive\nand manage requests for emergency medical response using an approved emergency medical\ndispatch protocol reference system, and the provision of pre-arrival instructions to callers at the\nscene of a medical emergency and to dispatch appropriate levels of response according to pre-\nestablished guidelines.\nB.

The Marin County Sheriff's Office (MCSO), Communications Division, is the sole EMD provider\nwithin Marin County.\nB. All “911” calls for medical assistance will be handled by currently certified Emergency Medical\nDispatchers. In the event that a request for medical assistance is received via a local agency\n‘business line’, the caller will be transferred or conferenced in to the Marin County Sheriff’s Office\nCommunications Center. If it is not possible to transfer the caller, the person handling the call will\nconfirm address, phone number and chief complaint. The person will then notify Marin County\nSheriff’s Office Communications Center and provide the information to an EMD dispatcher. The\nMCSO dispatcher will attempt to call back the reporting party and start appropriate resources to\nthe scene.\nC.

For several\nyears, the Prison contracted with private providers for all ambulance services. In April 2018, the Prison\ninformed the EMS Agency of their intent to resume using 911 for their emergent medical needs.\nAlthough response for these medical calls is the primary responsibility of Central Marin Fire and Ross\nValley Paramedic Authority, other zone providers or private providers may be dispatched based on\navailability.\nAUTHORITY\nHealth & Safety Code 1797.200, 1797.218, 1797.222\nDEFINITIONS\n1. Medical emergency – An emergent incident that requires 911 paramedic response and\ntransportation to an acute care hospital.\n2. Scheduled transports – non-emergency transports for routine medical appointments, tests or\ntreatment.\n3. TTA – Triage and Treatment Area, the primary location for healthcare services at the prison\n(see map).\nPROCEDURE (see attached map for identified locations)\n1. When a medical emergency requiring an ambulance occurs at San Quentin, prison staff will\ncall 911 and provide the following information:\na. Patient location (typically the TTA)\nb. Patient condition or chief complaint\n2. Responding EMS units will enter the prison property via the West Gate on Sir Francis Drake\nBlvd. and follow Levee Road to the sally port. A correctional officer will meet units at the gate\nor sally port to escort EMS personnel to the TTA or other patient location.\n3. The responding engine company shall stage at the San Quentin fire station outside the sally\nport and the driver/operator will remain with the apparatus.\n4. The other engine crew members will accompany the ambulance crew through the sally port\nand to the TTA.\n5.

Based on these and other developments, we expect further refinements to\nthis policy.\n1. Dispatch. While dispatch is not formally screening for EVD at this time, we\nhave been in discussion with dispatch and expect that they will pass along\nany information they obtain regarding EVD risk factors.\n2. Ebola screening questions for patients reporting infectious disease\nsymptoms. Any patient suspected of EVD prior to EMS arrival should be\ngreeted by a single EMS personnel in appropriate PPE and (if available) PPE\nfor the patient (mask and gown). Limit patient contact (maintain minimum\nthree foot distance) until the following screening questions have been asked:\na. Have you traveled outside the U.S. in the last three weeks, or been in\nclose contact with anyone who has?\nb. If Yes: Was that travel to West Africa, specifically Sierra Leone,\nLiberia or Guinea?\nc. If Yes: Do you have a fever >100.4 F, or headache, joint or muscle\naches, vomiting, diarrhea or abnormal bleeding?\n3. EMS Procedures and Transport.\nIf screen is positive to all THREE questions: activate PPE procedures.\nEMS personnel should limit treatment activities as appropriate with guidance\nfrom Online Medical Control. Well-appearing patients should receive BLS\nlevel care only.\nFor suspect patients who meet screening criteria, pre-hospital personnel\nshould adhere to employers’ Infectious Disease plan for utilizing PPE.
