      "text": "April 2022 County of Marin EMS 4613\n• Traumatic Arrest: Determination of death can be made prior to, or immediately after,\ninitiating resuscitation if:\nI. In an MCI incident where START triage principles preclude initiation of CPR\nOr if ALL of the following are present\nII. A patient has sustained blunt, penetrating or profound multi-system trauma, or\nsignificant blood loss\nIII. Pulseless and/or apnea\nIV. Absence of potentially reversible cause of arrest\nD. Destination for adult patients who meet Physiologic or Anatomic Criteria:\n• Transport to time closest trauma center\n• If the estimated ground transport time to the closest trauma center exceeds 30 minutes,\nconsider use of air ambulance\nI. Estimated ground transport time is evaluated from the time the patient is packaged and\nready for transport. Consider traffic conditions, weather, and other relevant factors.\nII. Estimated air transport time includes: minutes until arrival (if helicopter is not already on\nthe ground); scene and load time of flight crew (typically 10 minutes); flight time to\ntrauma center; and off-load time (typically 7-10 minutes). If helicopter is on the ground at\nthe time the patient is ready for transport, then air transport time is evaluated as time to\nload, flight time to trauma center and time to off-load to the ED.\nE. For adult patients meeting mechanism of injury or additional factors criteria, transport to\nMarinHeath Medical Center\nF. Destination for pediatric patients who meet physiologic or anatomic criteria:\n• Transport directly to Children’s Hospital Oakland (see Trauma Triage Tool)\n• If ETA (transport time) is anticipated to be >30 minutes, physician consultation should be\nobtained with the Level III trauma center to determine destination\nG. Incidents involving three or more patients meeting Physiologic or Anatomic Criteria will be\nhandled in the following manner:\n• Use of air ambulance should be considered\n• Prehospital providers shall consult with the Level III trauma center regarding destinations\n• Patients that the Level III trauma center cannot accept should be transported to an out-of-\ncounty Level I or II trauma center in the most appropriate and expedient manner\n• If an incident is a Multi-Casualty Incident (MCI), prehospital providers will utilize the Multiple\nPatient Management Plan for destination guidelines. The term “Immediate Trauma Patient”\nwill be used to describe an MCI patient that may need the services of a trauma center. The\ncoordinating hospital should consider the capacity at the local and regional trauma centers\nwhen making destination decisions.\nH. The EDAT will be used for patients meeting mechanism of injury or additional factors trauma\ncriteria that the Level III trauma center is unable to accept.",
