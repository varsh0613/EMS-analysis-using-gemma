This has become a national challenge that does not appear\n415 473 3344 TTY\nto be improving and we expect additional future shortages.\nwww.marinEMS.org\nIn order to provide a consistent process in dealing with this ongoing issue, the EMS\nAgency will use the following procedure:\n• The provider experiencing the medication shortage will notify the EMS\nAgency in writing.\n• The notification should include the name of the medication, the expiration\ndates, the expected dates for restock to arrive and proposed alternatives\n(action plan) to be used during the shortage period. We recommend the\naction plan consider all options and be based on historical medication\nutilization by the provider. Consideration should be given to: adjusting par\nlevels, substitution, or extension of expiration dates (if FDA approved).\n• The EMS Agency will review each request and will either approve the action\nplan or propose alternatives. Each request will be reviewed on a case-by-\ncase basis; and a separate request will be required for each medication if\nmultiple medications are on back order at the same time.",
