In\n415 473 3344 TTY\nCalifornia, fentanyl and its analogs have also been found in samples of other\nwww.marinEMS.org\ndrugs including heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and counterfeit pills made\nto look like prescription medications such as alprazolam (Xanax).\nSuch illicit drugs may pose as a contact hazard to law enforcement and other\nfirst responders and while we are not aware of any symptomatic first responder\nexposures in this county, we are taking this opportunity to remind first\nresponders of scene safety principles.\nWe are committed to ensuring the safety of our first responders and are\naddressing the fentanyl hazard in multiple ways -- including close monitoring of\nopioid overdoses in the county, educational programs to Emergency Medical\nServices and first responders as well as ongoing distribution of intranasal\nnaloxone (Narcan) to law enforcement and other agencies.\nThere is limited data to guide personal protective equipment (PPE)\nrecommendations as fentanyl and its analogs do not have established\noccupational exposure limits. First responder hazard is almost certainly greater\nwith inhalation of powder rather than contact via the skin.\nWe continue to recommend that first responder agencies follow the CDC\nguidelines on PPE and, as they suggest, assess the need and level of PPE on a\ncase by case basis: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/fentanyl/risk.html",
