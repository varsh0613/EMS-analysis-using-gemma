The spinal injury assessment should be performed prior to application of SMR.\nSMR describes the procedure used to care for patients with possible unstable spinal injuries\nFull SMR Modified SMR\n(Cervical collar with full-length vacuum (May include any of the following: rigid\nspring or rigid device with lateral cervical collar alone; self limiting motion;\nimmobilization and straps) padding to limit movement; KED; or 1/2\nlength vacuum splint)\n• Indications:\n• Patients with obvious acute neurologic • Indications:\ndeficit (paralysis or weakness) • Patients who do not meet criteria for full\n• Priapism or suspected spinal shock SMR, but who are at high risk due to\nblunt trauma mechanism\n• Procedure:\n• Ambulatory/self-extricated patients who\n• Assess motor/sensory function before\nhave mid-line neck pain and/or\nand after SMR application\ntenderness\n• regularly reassess and document\nmotor/sensory function (include finger • Procedure:\nabduction, wrist/finger extension, • Use the least invasive methods/tools\nplantar/dorsal flexion and sharp/dull available which minimize patient\nexam if possible) following application discomfort and respiratory compromise\nof SMR • Least invasive examples: Lateral,\n• Remove athletic equipment (if semi-fowler’s or fowler’s position with\napplicable) cervical collar only; pillows; vacuum\nsplint or gurney mattress; child’s car\n• Apply rigid cervical collar\nseat\n• Cervical collar may be omitted for\npatients with isolated lumbar and/or • Hard backboards should only be used\nlower thoracic spine tenderness when absolutely necessary (e.g.\n• If needed, extricate patient limiting patient transfer)\nmovement of the spine • Consider pull sheets, other flexible\ndevices (e.g. flat stretchers), or scoops\n• Apply adequate padding on\nand scoop-like devices\nbackboards or use vacuum mattress to\nprevent tissue ischemia and increase • Provide manual stabilization restricting\ncomfort gross motion.\n• Secure patient to device • Alert and cooperative patients may\n• Consider the use of SpO2 and EtCO2 be allowed to self-limit motion if\nto monitor respiratory function appropriate with or without cervical\ncollar\n• Self-extrication is allowable for\npatients meeting criteria for modified\nSMR",

      "text": "April 2022 County of Marin EMS GPC 13\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n• Full SMR is not benign; it can lead to pain, respiratory compromise, skin\nbreakdown and contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion in patients with\nstroke or head injury\n• Routine use of SMR should be avoided. Its use should be reserved for\npatients with confirmatory physical findings or high clinical suspicion of\nunstable spinal fracture\n• SMR is not indicated in patients with isolated penetrating trauma\n• Use SMR with caution with patients presenting with dyspnea and\nposition appropriately\n• If patient experiences negative effects of SMR methods used, alternative\nmeasures should be implemented as soon as possible\n• Pregnant patients >20 weeks: should be positioned on the left side,\nimmobilized as appropriate, supporting fetus\n• Combative patients: Avoid methods that provoke increased spinal\nmovement and/or combativeness\n• Athletic Equipment: (football helmet and shoulder pads; lacrosse helmet\nand shoulder pads; baseball/softball helmet)\n• In event of suspected spine injury during participation in equipment-\nintensive sport, removal of equipment is strongly recommended prior to\napplication of SMR\n• Equipment should be removed by the rescuers most familiar with the\nequipment (I.e. Athletic Trainers when present)\n• Removal of helmet and/or shoulder pads provides early access to the\npatient’s airway/chest\n• Pediatric patients\n• Consider the use of SpO2 and EtCO2 to monitor respiratory function\n• Consider use of padded pediatric motion restricting board\n• Avoid methods that provoke increased spinal movement\n• Unless secured to backboard, pediatric patients shall be transported in\na child restraint system (CRS)",
