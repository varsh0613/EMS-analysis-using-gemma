Emergency Medical Dispatch is the practice of utilizing trained and certified personnel to receive\nand manage requests for emergency medical response using an approved emergency medical\ndispatch protocol reference system, and the provision of pre-arrival instructions to callers at the\nscene of a medical emergency and to dispatch appropriate levels of response according to pre-\nestablished guidelines.\nB. Emergency Medical Dispatchers are persons who have completed an approved EMD training\ncourse, are EMD certified and employed by a designated EMD provider agency.\nPOLICY\nA. The Marin County Sheriff's Office (MCSO), Communications Division, is the sole EMD provider\nwithin Marin County.\nB. All “911” calls for medical assistance will be handled by currently certified Emergency Medical\nDispatchers. In the event that a request for medical assistance is received via a local agency\n‘business line’, the caller will be transferred or conferenced in to the Marin County Sheriff’s Office\nCommunications Center.
