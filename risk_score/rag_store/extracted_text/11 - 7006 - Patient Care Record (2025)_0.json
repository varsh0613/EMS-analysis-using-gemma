It shall be completed and\nposted as soon as possible and no later than 3 hours after completion of the call for all specialty notification\npatients (e.g. sepsis, stroke, STEMI, trauma) or critical patients (e.g. cardiac arrest and/or airway\nemergency), otherwise, it shall be completed and posted no later than 24 hours following completion of the\ncall (regardless of disposition).\nEMS personnel shall not leave shift with missing or incomplete PCRs outstanding. All transport crew\nmembers are responsible for the accuracy of the content of the PCR AND must sign each completed PCR.\nWillful omission, misuse, tampering, or falsification of documentation of patient care records is a violation\nunder Section 1978.200 of the California Health and Safety Code.\nDocumentation Requirements\nA. Only approved medical abbreviations may be used for PCR documentation (see Policy 7006B).\nB. The CAD to PCR interface should be used to populate all CAD data fields as appropriate.

      "text": "April 2025 County of Marin EMS 7006\nD. Personnel assigned outside of the county to provide medical mutual aid (e.g. fire-line\nEMT/Paramedic, cover engine assignment), shall complete a PCR for each patient contact.\nE. The PCR shall include all care rendered by the transporting providers as well as any care given prior\nto arrival by first responders and/or bystanders, including all procedures performed and medications\nadministered using the most appropriate sections of the ePCR and NOT just in the narrative. When\npossible, it shall include all standard ECGs and 12-lead ECGs obtained. When possible, pertinent\nphotographs from the scene should be attached to the ePCR (e.g. vehicle damage, eBike).\nF. Data gathering and documentation responsibilities should never take precedence over hands-on\nrescue and patient care. Nevertheless, prehospital information, particularly for critical patients, is\nessential for the emergency department and hospital course of care and every effort to obtain the\ninformation should be made.\nG. If ALS to BLS transfer of care is determined to be appropriate, documentation of assessments and all\ncare rendered must be completed by both the ALS and the BLS units according to EMS Policy.\nH. Color of length-based tape tool for all pediatric patients.\nI. A minimum of two complete sets of vital signs (VS) for every patient including pulse, respirations,\nblood pressure and pulse oximetry. Repeat and document VS every 5 minutes for unstable patients,\nand every 15 minutes for stable patients (e.g. BLS patients). When required by policy, a temperature\nshould also be documented at least once in the VS section. For children ≤ 3 years of age, blood\npressure does not need to be documented unless the child is critically ill for whom blood pressure\nmeasurement may guide treatment decisions.\nJ. Level of pain shall be recorded for all patients capable of providing it.\nK. All pertinent medications are taken by the patient prior to the arrival of EMS and/or administered by a\nfirst responder or bystander. Medications shall be documented in the appropriate fields and NOT only\nin the narrative.\nL. All cardiac monitor data. (imported from monitor)\nM. Neuromuscular status must be noted before and after immobilization for patients with extremity injury.\nN. Motor function before and after motion restriction if applicable.\nO. For all calls with a patient, the PCR shall contain the following minimum data elements:\n• Date and estimated time of event\n• Location of incident\n• Patient name\n• Patient address\n• Patient phone number\n• Patient gender\n• Date of birth\n• Race/Ethnicity\n• Patient weight (if applicable to treatment)\n• Chief complaint\n• Primary impression\n• Patient disposition\n• Contact information of the best medical historian\n• Name and contact info for medical decision maker (when not the patient)\n• Pertinent findings obtained by examination/assessment\n• Last known well (if applicable)",
