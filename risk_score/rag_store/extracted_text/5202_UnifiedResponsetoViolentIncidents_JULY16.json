      "text": "July 2016 COUNTY OF MARIN EMS 5202\nLaw Enforcement will be responsible for patient extrication if other first responders are not able\nto enter the scene. Patient extrication will be initiated at the earliest possible opportunity after\nthe scene is relatively secured and/or the threat is neutralized\nThe on scene Incident Commander/ Unified Command, in addition to departmental policies,\nwill determine PPE requirements for entry into any warm zones\nVI. Considerations\n• Communications must be maintained throughout the incident with respective dispatch\ncenters and on scene medical, fire and law enforcement\n• Law enforcement is in charge of the incident. While in a warm zone environment, EMS\nshould follow the direction of law enforcement\n• In accordance with department safety standards, EMS providers need to be ready to enter\na secured scene quickly and aggressively\n• Make sure law enforcement command knows that an EMS team is ready, staged and\nawaiting direction. Most SWAT teams have an imbedded tactical medic that would be the\nlogical liaison to EMS assets on scene\n• Law enforcement may provide a protective envelope (force protection model) around\nFire/EMS providers and escort them into “warm zone” areas to treat or extricate victims (No\nActive Threat in the Area)\n• EMS providers should be “forward leaning” and have trauma focused medical gear and\ntriage tools available\n• Working closely with law enforcement is critical in getting life saving medical assets to the\ninjured as soon as the threat has been mitigated or neutralized. The UNIFIED COMMAND\nmodel is best for these types of incidents\n• Make sure to have emergency egress routes and casualty collection points as well as\nevacuation rally points identified\n• If EMS team is brought into extricate patient, only minimal equipment should be carried.\nRoll up evacuation stretchers should be considered\n• EMS teams need to be prepared to split up if law enforcement requires it\n• EMS providers should use individual medical packs with lifesaving bleeding and airway\ntools so they can work “independently” on trauma victims\n• Patients should be moved as quickly as possible from CCP to FRFTS with only lifesaving\nprocedures performed in the warm zone if applicable\nReplaces March 2015 Page 2 of 3",
