      "text": "To: Marin County EMS Constituents\nFrom: Dustin Ballard, MD; Medical Director\nMarin County EMS Agency\nDate: October 28, 2014\nRe: Interim Policy Memo 2014-4\nEbola Virus Disease Procedures\nThe California EMS Authority is in the process of developing guidelines and\nprotocols for EMS management of patients with suspected Ebola Virus Disease\n(EVD). Based on these and other developments, we expect further refinements to\nthis policy.\n1. Dispatch. While dispatch is not formally screening for EVD at this time, we\nhave been in discussion with dispatch and expect that they will pass along\nany information they obtain regarding EVD risk factors.\n2. Ebola screening questions for patients reporting infectious disease\nsymptoms. Any patient suspected of EVD prior to EMS arrival should be\ngreeted by a single EMS personnel in appropriate PPE and (if available) PPE\nfor the patient (mask and gown). Limit patient contact (maintain minimum\nthree foot distance) until the following screening questions have been asked:\na. Have you traveled outside the U.S. in the last three weeks, or been in\nclose contact with anyone who has?\nb. If Yes: Was that travel to West Africa, specifically Sierra Leone,\nLiberia or Guinea?\nc. If Yes: Do you have a fever >100.4 F, or headache, joint or muscle\naches, vomiting, diarrhea or abnormal bleeding?\n3. EMS Procedures and Transport.\nIf screen is positive to all THREE questions: activate PPE procedures.\nEMS personnel should limit treatment activities as appropriate with guidance\nfrom Online Medical Control. Well-appearing patients should receive BLS\nlevel care only.\nFor suspect patients who meet screening criteria, pre-hospital personnel\nshould adhere to employers’ Infectious Disease plan for utilizing PPE. As of\nthis date, CDC guidelines recommend the following:",

EMS Destination. Patient destination, at this time, should be followed according to Destination\nGuidelines GPC 4, with direction from Online Medical Control as needed. In the future, if Ebola\nReceiving Centers are designated, this destination policy may be subject to change.\n5. Hospital Contact\nIf screen is positive to all THREE questions:\na. Inform receiving hospital via phone of a “Screened Positive Patient.”\nb. Request that the hospital notify Marin County Public Health.\n6. Hospital Patient Handoff\na. Each receiving hospital in Marin has developed a specific protocol for receiving suspected EVD\npatients via EMS.\nb. Upon arrival to receiving facility, the driver will establish phone contact with designated hospital\npersonnel and await further instructions before patient off-loading.\n1) Marin General Hospital: 415-925-7203\n2) Kaiser Permanente San Rafael: 415-444-2415\n3) Novato Community Hospital: 415-209-1350\nc. Hold patient inside of the ambulance while hospital staff prepares to receive the patient.\nd. Hospital personnel, in PPE, will meet patient with hospital gurney and transport the patient to a\npre-designated unit. Provide verbal report only.\ne. Patient crew will remove and dispose of PPE in a designated area following infection control\nprocedures.\nf. The gurney and all equipment will be considered infectious and handled with the appropriate\nPPE until properly decontaminated.\n7. EMS Doffing and Decontamination. We recommend providers follow CDC guidelines for donning\nand doffing of PPE. (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/procedures-for-ppe.html). Ambulance\ndecontamination: it is not reasonable to expect EMS personnel to decontaminate an ambulance\nthat has transported a suspect EVD patient in the ambulance bay of a hospital. There are three\noptions:\na. The ambulance is removed to a location where it is taken out of service and quarantined until\npublic health determines patient is not a risk.\nb. The ambulance is removed to a location where specially trained workers decontaminate the unit\nand return it to service.\nc. The hospital uses its trained environmental staff to decontaminate on site and allow the\nambulance back in service.\n8. Documentation. Complete electronic PCR only after decontamination and doffing procedures have\nbeen completed. When appropriate, PCRs will include documentation in the narrative section to\ninclude “EVD screening questions addressed.”",
