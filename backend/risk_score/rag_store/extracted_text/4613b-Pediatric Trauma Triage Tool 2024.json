      "text": "April 2024 County of Marin EMS 4613b\nTrauma Notification\n• Field personnel will advise the trauma center a minimum of 10 minutes prior to arrival (or as soon\nas possible if transport is <10min) by providing a Trauma Notification. This information will be\nused to activate the trauma team. Communication with the hospital via MERA is preferred. The\nnotification must include at a minimum the following information:\n• Medic unit and transport code\n• Trauma Notification\n• Patient age and gender\n• M- Mechanism of injury\n• I- Injury and/or complaints; significant injuries and findings\n• V- Vital signs; blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, GCS\n• T- Treatment/interventions\n• ETA\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n• The clinical findings, including past medical history, are critical to identifying the trauma patient,\nespecially when assessing Mechanism of Injury (MOI) and additional factors\n• A thorough clinical assessment is especially important in patients with:\n• Persistent and unexplained respiratory difficulty, tachycardia, or peripheral vasoconstriction\n• Inability to communicate (e.g. language barrier, substance abuse or psychiatric impairment)\n• There are MOI not identified in the Trauma Triage Tool that may be associated with trauma. Any\nfall or impact with significant velocity is likely to produce a candidate for trauma activation\n☎\nPHYSICIAN CONSULT\n• Trauma Center consultation is recommended for questions about destinations for injured patients",
